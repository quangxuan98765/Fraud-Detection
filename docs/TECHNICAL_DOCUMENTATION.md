# Graph Database Fraud Detection System - Technical Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides detailed technical documentation for the graph database-based fraud detection system implemented for the thesis "Exploring Graph Databases and Their Applications". The system utilizes Neo4j as the graph database platform and implements various graph algorithms to detect fraudulent financial transactions. The current implementation has been optimized for a dataset with 1.38% fraud prevalence, demonstrating the system's adaptability to different fraud patterns and rates.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### 1.1. Database Layer
- **Technology**: Neo4j Graph Database
- **Data Model**:
  - Nodes: Account entities with attributes like ID, anomaly scores, and graph metrics
  - Relationships: SENT relationship between accounts representing transactions
  - Properties: Amount, timestamp (step), transaction type, anomaly scores
- **Indexes**: Account ID index for efficient lookups

#### 1.2. Detection Engine
- **Feature Extraction Module**: Calculates graph metrics for fraud detection
- **Anomaly Detection Module**: Identifies unusual patterns in transaction data
- **Fraud Detection Module**: Main detection logic with multi-level confidence rules
- **Evaluation Module**: Measures performance against ground truth data

#### 1.3. API Layer
- **REST API**: Endpoints for data access and visualization
- **Web Interface**: Interactive visualization of fraud detection results

### 2. Algorithm Implementation

#### 2.1. Graph Algorithms Used
- **PageRank**: Identifies influential nodes in the transaction network
- **Degree Centrality**: Measures the number of connections each node has
- **Community Detection (Louvain)**: Groups accounts into communities based on transaction patterns
- **Node Similarity**: Identifies accounts with similar transaction patterns
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Detects accounts that bridge different transaction communities
- **HITS Algorithm**: Identifies hub and authority nodes in the network
- **K-Core**: Finds densely connected account subnetworks
- **Triangle Count**: Detects highly interconnected account clusters
- **Cycle Detection**: Identifies cyclic transaction patterns typical in money laundering

#### 2.2. Feature Weighting
The system uses an optimized feature weighting scheme:
- `degScore` (Degree Centrality): 38%
- `hubScore` (HITS Hub Score): 22%
- `normCommunitySize` (Normalized Community Size): 18%
- `amountVolatility`: 6%
- `txVelocity` (Transaction Velocity): 6%
- `btwScore` (Betweenness Centrality): 4%
- `prScore` (PageRank): 3%
- `authScore` (HITS Authority Score): 3%

## Implementation Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
1. **Data Import**: Transaction data is imported from CSV files with sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp information
2. **Data Limiting**: System handles large datasets by limiting to configurable number of accounts and transactions
3. **Ground Truth Tagging**: Transactions are tagged with ground truth fraud status for evaluation

### 2. Graph Processing Pipeline

#### 2.1. Graph Projection
The system creates three specialized graph projections:
1. **Main Graph**: Standard account-transaction-account projection
2. **Similarity Graph**: For node similarity calculations
3. **Temporal Graph**: For temporal pattern analysis with time weights

#### 2.2. Feature Calculation
For each account node, the system calculates:
- **Structural Features**: Centrality measures, community membership
- **Temporal Features**: Transaction bursts, velocity changes
- **Amount Features**: Unusual amount patterns, volatility

#### 2.3. Anomaly Score Calculation
1. Combined weighted feature score formula:
   ```
   anomaly_score = Σ(feature_value * feature_weight)
   ```
2. Percentile-based thresholds:
   - Very high: 99th percentile (0.165)
   - High: 97.5th percentile (0.150)
   - Medium: 95th percentile (0.144)
   - Low: 90th percentile (0.141)

### 3. Multi-Level Fraud Detection Process

#### 3.1. Detection Phases
1. **Basic Anomaly Detection**:
   - Calculates basic anomaly scores using optimized feature weights
   - Applies initial statistics and percentile thresholds

2. **Tiered Confidence Detection**:
   - Very High Confidence (96%): 
     - Extreme anomaly scores (threshold * 1.08)
     - High anomaly + suspicious graph structure (hub score ≥ 0.85 or community size ≤ 0.04)
     - High anomaly + large transaction amounts
   
   - High Confidence (84%):
     - High anomaly scores
     - Medium anomaly + suspicious graph structure
     - Medium anomaly + high transaction amounts
   
   - Medium Confidence (72%):
     - Medium anomaly scores
     - Low anomaly + multiple suspicious patterns

   - Low Confidence (56%, Recall mode only):
     - Very large transactions (8x avg amount)
     - High hub score with moderate anomaly score
     - Medium anomaly + high transaction velocity

3. **Related Fraud Detection**:
   - Identifies accounts involved in high-confidence fraudulent transactions
   - Extends detection to other transactions from these accounts

4. **False Positive Filtering**:
   - Precision Mode: Aggressively filters low-confidence detections
   - Balanced Mode: Moderate filtering
   - Recall Mode: Minimal filtering with basic statistical refinement

#### 3.2. Mode-Specific Strategies
1. **Precision Mode**: Prioritizes minimizing false positives
2. **Recall Mode**: Prioritizes minimizing false negatives
3. **Balanced Mode**: Aims for optimal F1 score

### 4. Query Implementation
The system uses Cypher queries extensively for detection logic:

#### 4.1. Example: Very High Confidence Detection
```cypher
MATCH (src:Account)-[tx:SENT]->(dest:Account)
WHERE 
    // Extremely high anomaly score
    tx.anomaly_score >= $very_high_threshold * 1.08
    
    // OR high anomaly score WITH suspicious graph structure
    OR (tx.anomaly_score >= $very_high_threshold AND 
        (
            (src.hubScore IS NOT NULL AND src.hubScore >= 0.85) OR
            (src.normCommunitySize IS NOT NULL AND src.normCommunitySize <= 0.04)
        )
    )
    
    // OR high anomaly score WITH very large amount
    OR (tx.anomaly_score >= $very_high_threshold AND tx.amount >= $amount_high * 1.2)
    
SET tx.flagged = true,
    tx.confidence = $very_high_confidence,
    tx.flag_reason = CASE
        WHEN tx.anomaly_score >= $very_high_threshold * 1.08 THEN "Điểm anomaly cực cao"
        WHEN tx.amount >= $amount_high * 1.2 THEN "Điểm anomaly cao + giá trị giao dịch rất cao"
        ELSE "Điểm anomaly cao + cấu trúc đồ thị rất đáng ngờ"
    END,
    tx.detection_rule = "very_high_confidence"
```

#### 4.2. Example: Statistics Calculation
```cypher
MATCH ()-[tx:SENT]->()
WITH
    percentileCont(tx.anomaly_score, 0.99) AS very_high_threshold,
    percentileCont(tx.anomaly_score, 0.975) AS high_threshold,
    percentileCont(tx.anomaly_score, 0.95) AS medium_threshold,
    percentileCont(tx.anomaly_score, 0.90) AS low_threshold,
    percentileCont(tx.amount, 0.99) AS high_amount,
    percentileCont(tx.amount, 0.90) AS medium_amount,
    AVG(tx.amount) as avg_amount,
    STDEV(tx.amount) as std_amount,
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN tx.ground_truth_fraud = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fraud_count
RETURN *
```
